"THE BEER-WARE LICENSE" (Revision 42.5):
<mikeserg@gmail.com> is the maintainer of this project. As long as you retain 
this notice you can do whatever you want with this stuff. If we meet some day,
and you think this stuff is worth it, you can buy me a beer in return 
Mike Sergio.

On the off chance that you use portions of this and make a lot of money 
(> 20 USD), fairness dictates that you must buy me a beer.
